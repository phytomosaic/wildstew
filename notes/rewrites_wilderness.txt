Protocol

Step 1: Retrieve automated report from [Wilderness Automatic Reports](https://ecol.shinyapps.io/wildstew/) tool. Navigate to the Forest Service [Wilderness Automatic Reports](https://ecol.shinyapps.io/wildstew/) tool, and select the wilderness area(s) of interest.  After PDF downloads, find the section entitled "Wilderness Character Monitoring".  This section reports statistical tests for trends in the lichen indices at ten-year intervals (10 y = the sampling interval for lichen plots).

Air pollution scores ("airscores") for nitrogen and sulfur are based on the lichen community composition and abundances.  Higher lichen airscores indicate that more nitrogen and sulfur pollution is impacting lichens on the plot; lower airscores indicate less relative impact of air pollution.

The statistical test for trend in lichen airscores has been done for you in the automated report.  This is a two-tailed, paired t-test with an alpha level of 0.05 to determine whether the lichen airscores differ significantly from one decade to another.  Also included are results from a power analysis that indicate whether or not the wilderness area has the sufficient number of plots required to detect a trend.

The baseline decade starts at the first year of data collection following wilderness designation.  The statistical tests compare trends decade to decade, because lichens are sampled on 10-year intervals.  Compare values from the earliest decade to the most recent. If significant trend exists (p-value < 0.05), then the automatic report tells you the direction of change.  Assign the applicable trend category from the options described in this list:

• Decreasing air pollution: statistically significant decreasing trend in lichen airscores (better air quality).
• Stable air pollution: no statistically significant trend in lichen airscores.
• Increasing air pollution: statistically significant increasing trend in lichen airscores (worse air quality).

Select the "stable" air pollution category for the baseline decade (i.e., the first period of data collection following wilderness designation).  Contact an air resource specialist for assistance in further interpreting the lichen airscores.

Step 2: Enter data in the WCMD. Enter the assigned trend category for air pollution in the WCMD for this measure. The measure value is the trend category for
air pollution.
